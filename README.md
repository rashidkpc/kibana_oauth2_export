# kibana_oauth2_export
There's really no reason to use this. It's a small node script to, poorly, export documents from old Kibana instances behind oauth from the command line. There is no support for this, the code is simple enough that you could, and should, write your own. In fact, it would probably be easier to write it yourself than to adapt this for your purpose.
